# Traffic-flow-predition-# Traffic Flow Prediction with Various Models

This project aims to predict traffic flow using different models for accurate traffic management and planning.

## Data

The dataset contains historical traffic records, including volume, weather conditions, and temporal information.

## Models

Multiple models are employed, including  RNN, custom LSTM, and bidirectional LSTM model, to capture spatial and temporal patterns in traffic data.
