This study examines the importance of traffic flow prediction  
in Smart System and the advancements in Artificial Intelligence. 
The review focuses on the application of techniques Deep learning for 
traffic flow prediction.Deep learning models, with their simplified data
 preprocessing and higher accuracy, have gained attention in data-driven traffic flow prediction. The study highlights the positive impact of smart cities on transportation networks and emphasizes the need to leverage ML and DL technologies for predicting traffic flow. The proposed approach involves a DL model, specifically a Recurrent Neural Network with Long Short-Term Memory, for predicting traffic volume between Minneapolis and St. Paul in Minnesota.

2. Issues for traffic congestion:

In many places across the world, traffic congestion is a serious issue. 
It is difficult to accurately define and forecast because it is influenced
 by a wide range of diverse elements. Some of the main problems caused by 
traffic congestion are air pollution, lengthy commutes, traffic jams, unreliable
 public transportation, and traffic accidents.  
In order to create smooth traffic flow conditions on road networks, we must address 
the major issue of traffic congestion. Due to rising traffic demands, expanding the 
road network infrastructure by widening the roadways was simply insufficient to manage
 the smooth traffic flow conditions. To model the traffic flow circumstances, some type
 of traffic flow modelling methodology is needed that we will try to implement in this project.

3. Algorithms for generating traffic predictions (MODELS):


When it comes to traffic flow prediction, deep learning approaches have
 shown significant effectiveness compared to machine learning or statistical
 techniques, consistently achieving around 90% forecasting accuracy or higher. 
Deep learning algorithms, particularly neural networks, have been widely used in 
traffic analysis and prediction. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are designed for
 time-series analysis and have proven effective in anticipating congestion evolution.
 However, RNNs suffer from the vanishing gradient problem, which limits their long-term memory. 
To address this, variations such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) 
have been developed, with GRU models often demonstrating higher accuracy and ease of training in
 traffic flow predictions. Other neural network models, including graph neural networks, 
fuzzy neural networks, and Bayesian neural networks, have also been explored, alongside hybrid
 techniques that combine multiple algorithms. It's important to note that there is no one-size-fit
s-all technique for traffic prediction, and the availability of large datasets plays a crucial 
role in training and fine-tuning ML/DL models for achieving more accurate results.


4. Comparing the performance of our model with other novel algorithms


Short-term traffic flow prediction is crucial for intelligent transportation systems, and 
incorporating additional spatial and temporal traffic information can enhance the accuracy of 
estimating traffic on a larger road network. LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is an effective 
approach for this task, allowing the model to have long-term memory and capture dependencies
 in sequential data. The number of layers in an LSTM model affects its learning capacity, but
 it also increases the risk of overfitting.

On the other hand, CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) introduces filtering layers with adjustable weights to extract relevant features from data. CNN can reduce the number of parameters required for training while maintaining performance, leveraging the combination of signal processing and deep learning. LSTM, although requiring more parameters than CNN, excels in handling lengthy input sequences without significantly increasing network size.

In the context of traffic flow prediction, LSTM RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) models address the vanishing gradient problem of traditional RNN architectures. LSTM provides memory cells with the ability to selectively forget information, allowing for optimal time lags in time series problems. This makes LSTM RNN particularly well-suited for short-term traffic flow prediction, leveraging its long-standing memory capacity. Studies have shown that LSTM RNN outperforms many non-parametric models in traffic flow prediction tasks.
